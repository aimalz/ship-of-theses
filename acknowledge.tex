\begin{itemize}
	\item David W. Hogg: for teaching me how to fend for myself and forge my own collaborations, for funding a free-range grad student with highly speculative payoff
	\item Phil Marshall: for giving me a chance to earn legitimacy, taking me seriously and teaching me how to science
	\item both: for all the crazy ideas and wagers that evolved into fully fledged projects.
	Thank you for never letting me forget the real reason we do this -- because itâ€™s fun!
	\item I would like to thank the entire LSST-DESC, for providing me with an endless supply of hopeless, and thus interesting, problems and supporting me in investigating solutions. 
	I would especially like to thank Anja von der Linden, Sam Schmidt, and Michael Schneider for believing in me and amplifying my voice before I had the credibility to be heard by myself.
	\item I would like to thank all the hacking hackers who taught me to hack, from Daniela Huppenkothen and Astro Hack Week to Emille Ishida and the Cosmostatistics Initiative.
	\item I thank my peers at NYU for years of camaraderie: David, MJ, Chang, Geoff, Kilian, Nitya, Dun, Kate, and Dan.
	\item I thank the Flatiron Institute for generous nutritional support.
	\item I thank Laura Kay and Steinn Sigurdsson for facilitating my transfer to NYU -- I wouldn't be getting a Ph.D. without you.
	\item I thank Asumana Randolph for encouraging me to pursue astrophysics every step of the way, and all the Hunter College High School Freaks who welcomed me back to NYC.
	\item I express gratitude to Habitica, the gamified to-do list that motivated hundreds of hours of research.
	\item Finally, I thank my spousal unit, Marty, who has stuck with me through over a decade of schooling and mooching.
