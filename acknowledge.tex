\begin{itemize}
	\item David W. Hogg: for teaching me how to fend for myself and forge my own collaborations, for funding a free-range grad student with highly speculative payoff
	\item Phil Marshall: for giving me a chance to earn legitimacy, taking me seriously and teaching me how to science
	\item both: for crazy ideas, wagers, and not letting me forget that we do this because itâ€™s fun!
	\item I would like to thank the entire LSST-DESC, for providing me with an endless supply of hopeless, and thus interesting, problems and supporting me in investigating solutions. 
	I would especially like to thank Anja von der Linden, Sam Schmidt, and Michael Schneider for believing in me and amplifying my voice before I had the credibility to be heard by myself.
	\item I would like to thank all the hacking hackers who taught me to hack, from Daniela Huppenkothen and Astro Hack Week to Emille Ishida and the Cosmostatistics Initiative.
	\item I thank my peers at NYU for years of camaraderie: David Mykytyn, MJ Vakili, ChangHoon Hahn, Geoff Ryan, Kilian Walsh, Nitya Mandyam Doddamane, Dun Wang, and Dan Foreman-Mackey.
	\item I thank Laura Kay, Steinn Sigurdsson for supporting my transfer to NYU -- I wouldn't have made it here without you.
	\item I thank Asumana Randolph and all the Hunter College High School Freaks who welcomed my return to NYC.
	\item Finally, I thank my spousal unit, who has stuck with me through over a decade of schooling and mooching.
