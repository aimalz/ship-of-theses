Upcoming optical telescope surveys, among them the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (\textsc{LSST}), will produce tremendous catalogs of purely photometric data from galaxies, transients, and as yet undiscovered physical phenomena fainter than have ever been observed before, few of which will ever be spectroscopically confirmed.
Existing analysis techniques in cosmology and population-level studies of galaxies and transients make assumptions regarding the nature of the data that will not hold in this new uncertainty-dominated regime.
This thesis explores new methodologies for cosmology and the time-domain sky using the probabilistic descriptions appropriate for the data quality anticipated of next-generation observational astrophysics missions.
