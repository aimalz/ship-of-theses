	abstract = {One of the consequences of entering the era of precision cosmology is the widespread adoption of photometric redshift probability density functions (PDFs). Both current and future photometric surveys are expected to obtain images of billions of distinct galaxies. As a result, storing and analysing all of these PDFs will be non-trivial and even more severe if a survey plans to compute and store multiple different PDFs. In this paper we propose the use of a sparse basis representation to fully represent individual photo-z PDFs. By using an orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm and a combination of Gaussian and Voigt basis functions, we demonstrate how our approach is superior to a multi-Gaussian fitting, as we require approximately half of the parameters for the same fitting accuracy with the additional advantage that an entire PDF can be stored by using a 4-byte integer per basis function, and we can achieve better accuracy by increasing the number of bases. By using data from the Canada{\textendash}France{\textendash}Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey, we demonstrate that only 10{\textendash}20 points per galaxy are sufficient to reconstruct both the individual PDFs and the ensemble redshift distribution, N(z), to an accuracy of 99.9~per cent when compared to the one built using the original PDFs computed with a resolution of $\delta$z~=~0.01, reducing the required storage of 200 original values by a factor of 10{\textendash}20. Finally, we demonstrate how this basis representation can be directly extended to a cosmological analysis, thereby increasing computational performance without losing resolution nor accuracy.},

	abstract = {Photometric redshifts are quickly becoming an essential tool of observational cosmology, although their utilization is somewhat hindered by certain shortcomings of the existing methods, e.g., the unreliability of maximum-likelihood techniques or the limited application range of the "training-set" approach. The application of Bayesian inference to the problem of photometric redshift estimation effectively overcomes most of these problems. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization facilitates the inclusion of relevant knowledge, such as the expected shape of the redshift distributions and the galaxy type fractions, which can be readily obtained from existing surveys but are often ignored by other methods. If this previous information is lacking or insufficient{\textemdash}for instance, because of the unprecedented depth of the observations{\textemdash}the corresponding prior distributions can be calibrated using even the data sample for which the photometric redshifts are being obtained. An important advantage of Bayesian statistics is that the accuracy of the redshift estimation can be characterized in a way that has no equivalents in other statistical approaches, enabling the selection of galaxy samples with extremely reliable photometric redshifts. In this way, it is possible to determine the properties of individual galaxies more accurately, and simultaneously estimate the statistical properties of a sample in an optimal fashion. Moreover, the Bayesian formalism described here can be easily generalized to deal with a wide range of problems that make use of photometric redshifts. There is excellent agreement between the ?130 Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N) spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms error of $\Delta$ z ? 0.06(1 + z spec ) up to z {\textless} 6 and no outliers nor systematic biases. It should be remarked that since these results have not been reached following a training-set procedure, the above value of $\Delta$ z should be a fair estimate of the expected accuracy for any similar sample. The method is further tested by estimating redshifts in the HDF-N but restricting the color information to the UBVI filters; the results are shown to be significantly more reliable than those obtained with maximum-likelihood techniques.},

	abstract = {The use of photometric redshifts in cosmology is increasing. Often, however these photo-z are treated like spectroscopic observations, in that the peak of the photometric redshift, rather than the full probability density function (PDF), is used. This overlooks useful information inherent in the full PDF. We introduce a new real-space estimator for one of the most used cosmological statistics, the two-point correlation function, that weights by the PDF of individual photometric objects in a manner that is optimal when Poisson statistics dominate. As our estimator does not bin based on the PDF peak, it substantially enhances the clustering signal by usefully incorporating information from all photometric objects that overlap the redshift bin of interest. As a real-world application, we measure quasi-stellar object (QSO) clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that our simplest binned estimator improves the clustering signal by a factor equivalent to increasing the survey size by a factor of 2{\textendash}3. We also introduce a new implementation that fully weights between pairs of objects in constructing the cross-correlation and find that this pair-weighted estimator improves clustering signal in a manner equivalent to increasing the survey size by a factor of 4{\textendash}5. Our technique uses spectroscopic data to anchor the distance scale and it will be particularly useful where spectroscopic data (e.g. from BOSS) overlap deeper photometry (e.g. from Pan-STARRS, DES or the LSST). We additionally provide simple, informative expressions to determine when our estimator will be competitive with the autocorrelation of spectroscopic objects. Although we use QSOs as an example population, our estimator can and should be applied to any clustering estimate that uses photometric objects.},

We use this new model to study the impact of the choice of stellar population synthesis (SPS) model on the predicted evolution of the galaxy luminosity function. The semi-analytical model is run using seven different SPS models. In each case, we obtain the rest-frame luminosity function in the far-ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared (NIR) wavelength ranges. We find that both the predicted rest-frame ultraviolet and optical luminosity function are insensitive to the choice of SPS model. However, we find that the predicted evolution of the rest-frame NIR luminosity function depends strongly on the treatment of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stellar phase in the SPS models, with differences larger than a factor of 2 for model galaxies brighter than MAB(K) - 5 log h~\&lt;~-22 (\~{}L* for 0~<=~z~<=~1.5). We have also explored the predicted number counts of galaxies, finding remarkable agreement between the results with different choices of SPS model, except when selecting galaxies with very red optical{\textendash}NIR colours. The predicted number counts of these extremely red galaxies appear to be more affected by the treatment of star formation in discs than by the treatment of TP-AGB stars in the SPS models.},

	abstract = {(Abridged) We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). A vast array of science will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will have unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pach{\textbackslash}'\{o\}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel camera. This system can image about 10,000 square degrees of sky in three clear nights using pairs of 15-second exposures twice per night, with typical 5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ depth for point sources of \$r{\textbackslash}sim24.5\$ (AB). The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ with \${\textbackslash}delta{\textless}+34.5{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, \$ugrizy\$, covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90{\textbackslash}\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to \$r{\textbackslash}sim27.5\$. The remaining 10{\textbackslash}\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a Very Deep and Fast time domain survey. The goal is to make LSST data products, including a relational database of about 32 trillion observations of 40 billion objects, available to the public and scientists around the world.},

	abstract = {We introduce a method for constructing end-to-end mock galaxy catalogues using a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, applied to the halo merger trees extracted from a cosmological N-body simulation. The mocks that we construct are lightcone catalogues, in which a galaxy is placed according to the epoch at which it first enters the past lightcone of the observer, and incorporate the evolution of galaxy properties with cosmic time. We determine the position between the snapshot outputs at which a galaxy enters the observer's lightcone by interpolation. As an application, we consider the effectiveness of the BzK colour selection technique, which was designed to isolate galaxies in the redshift interval 1.4~\&lt; z~\&lt; 2.5. The mock catalogue is in reasonable agreement with the observed number counts of all BzK galaxies, as well as with the observed counts of the subsample of BzKs that are star-forming galaxies. We predict that over 75 per cent of the model galaxies with KAB~<= 23, and 1.4~\&lt; z~\&lt; 2.5, are selected by the BzK technique. Interloper galaxies, outside the intended redshift range, are predicted to dominate bright samples of BzK galaxies (i.e. with KAB~<= 21). Fainter K-band cuts are necessary to reduce the predicted interloper fraction. We also show that shallow B-band photometry can lead to confusion in classifying BzK galaxies as being star forming or passively evolving. Overall, we conclude that the BzK colour selection technique is capable of providing a sample of galaxies that is representative of the 1.4~\&lt; z~\&lt; 2.5 galaxy population.},

	abstract = {Key questions that scientists and engineers typically want to address can be formulated in terms of predictive science. Questions such as: "How well does my computational model represent reality?", "What are the most important parameters in the problem?", and "What is the best next experiment to perform?" are fundamental in solving scientific problems. Mystic is a framework for massively-parallel optimization and rigorous sensitivity analysis that enables these motivating questions to be addressed quantitatively as global optimization problems. Often realistic physics, engineering, and materials models may have hundreds of input parameters, hundreds of constraints, and may require execution times of seconds or longer. In more extreme cases, realistic models may be multi-scale, and require the use of high-performance computing clusters for their evaluation. Predictive calculations, formulated as a global optimization over a potential surface in design parameter space, may require an already prohibitively large simulation to be performed hundreds, if not thousands, of times. The need to prepare, schedule, and monitor thousands of model evaluations, and dynamically explore and analyze results, is a challenging problem that requires a software infrastructure capable of distributing and managing computations on large-scale heterogeneous resources. In this paper, we present the design behind an optimization framework, and also a framework for heterogeneous computing, that when utilized together, can make computationally intractable sensitivity and optimization problems much more tractable.},

	abstract = {Wide field images taken in several photometric bands allow simultaneous measurement of redshifts for thousands of galaxies. A variety of algorithms to make this measurement have appeared in the last few years, the majority of which can be classified as either template- or training-based methods. Among the latter, nearest neighbour estimators stand out as one of the most successful, in terms of both precision and the quality of error estimation. In this paper we describe the Directional Neighbourhood Fitting (DNF) algorithm based on the following: a new neighbourhood metric (Directional Neighbourhood), a photo-z estimation strategy (Neighbourhood Fitting) and a method for generating the photo-z probability distribution function. We compare DNF with other well-known empirical photometric redshift tools using different public data sets (Sloan Digital Sky Survey, VIMOS VLT Deep Survey and Photo-z Accuracy Testing). DNF achieves high-quality results with reliable error.},

	abstract = {A variety of fundamental astrophysical science topics require the determination of very accurate photometric redshifts (photo-z). A wide plethora of methods have been developed, based either on template models fitting or on empirical explorations of the photometric parameter space. Machine-learning-based techniques are not explicitly dependent on the physical priors and able to produce accurate photo-z estimations within the photometric ranges derived from the spectroscopic training set. These estimates, however, are not easy to characterize in terms of a photo-z probability density function (PDF), due to the fact that the analytical relation mapping the photometric parameters on to the redshift space is virtually unknown. We present METAPHOR (Machine learning Estimation Tool for Accurate PHOtometric Redshifts), a method designed to provide a reliable PDF of the error distribution for empirical techniques. The method is implemented as a modular workflow, whose internal engine for photo-z estimation makes use of the MLPQNA neural network (Multi Layer Perceptron with Quasi Newton learning rule), with the possibility to easily replace the specific machine-learning model chosen to predict photo-z. We present a summary of results on SDSS-DR9 galaxy data, used also to perform a direct comparison with PDFs obtained by the Le Phare spectral energy distribution template fitting. We show that METAPHOR is capable to estimate the precision and reliability of photometric redshifts obtained with three different self-adaptive techniques, i.e. MLPQNA, Random Forest and the standard K-Nearest Neighbors models.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore the applicability of the unsupervised machine learning technique of self-organizing maps (SOM) to estimate galaxy photometric redshift probability density functions (PDFs). This technique takes a spectroscopic training set, and maps the photometric attributes, but not the redshifts, to a two-dimensional surface by using a process of competitive learning where neurons compete to more closely resemble the training data multidimensional space. The key feature of a SOM is that it retains the topology of the input set, revealing correlations between the attributes that are not easily identified. We test three different 2D topological mapping: rectangular, hexagonal and spherical, by using data from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 survey. We also explore different implementations and boundary conditions on the map and also introduce the idea of a random atlas, where a large number of different maps are created and their individual predictions are aggregated to produce a more robust photometric redshift PDF. We also introduced a new metric, the I-score, which efficiently incorporates different metrics, making it easier to compare different results (from different parameters or different photometric redshift codes). We find that by using a spherical topology mapping we obtain a better representation of the underlying multidimensional topology, which provides more accurate results that are comparable to other, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Our results illustrate that unsupervised approaches have great potential for many astronomical problems, and in particular for the computation of photometric redshifts.},

In contrast to standard cross-correlation function estimators, we present a method that requires spectroscopy only for the AGN and uses photometric redshift probability distribution functions for galaxies to determine the projected real-space AGN/galaxy cross-correlation function. The estimated dark matter halo mass of X-ray AGN in the combined AEGIS, COSMOS and ECDFS fields is ?13 h-1~M?, in agreement with previous studies at similar redshift and luminosity ranges. Removing from the sample the 5~per~cent of the AGN associated with X-ray selected groups results in a reduction by about 0.5~dex in the inferred AGN dark matter halo mass. The distribution of AGN in dark matter halo mass is therefore skewed and the bulk of the population lives in moderate mass haloes. This result favours cold gas accretion as the main channel of supermassive black hole growth for most X-ray AGN.},

Our analyses account for all cross-correlations within and across probes and include the higher-order (non-Gaussian) terms in the multiprobe covariance matrix. We simultaneously model cosmological parameters and a variety of systematics, e.g. uncertainties arising from shear and photo-z calibration, cluster mass-observable relation, galaxy intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias (up to 54 parameters altogether). We highlight two results: first, increasing the number density of source galaxies by \~{}30~per~cent, which corresponds to solving blending for LSST, only gains little information.

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg{\textasciicircum}2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg{\textasciicircum}2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r{\textasciitilde}27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z{\textasciitilde}1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

	abstract = {We present a machine-learning photometric redshift analysis of the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 3, using two neural-network based techniques: ANNz2 and MLPQNA. Despite limited coverage of spectroscopic training sets, these ML codes provide photo-zs of quality comparable to, if not better than, those from the BPZ code, at least up to zphot{\textless}0.9 and r{\textless}23.5. At the bright end of r{\textless}20, where very complete spectroscopic data overlapping with KiDS are available, the performance of the ML photo-zs clearly surpasses that of BPZ, currently the primary photo-z method for KiDS. Using the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey as calibration, we furthermore study how photo-zs improve for bright sources when photometric parameters additional to magnitudes are included in the photo-z derivation, as well as when VIKING and WISE infrared bands are added. While the fiducial four-band ugri setup gives a photo-z bias \${\textbackslash}delta z=-2e-4\$ and scatter \${\textbackslash}sigma\_z{\textless}0.022\$ at mean z = 0.23, combining magnitudes, colours, and galaxy sizes reduces the scatter by {\textasciitilde}7\% and the bias by an order of magnitude. Once the ugri and IR magnitudes are joined into 12-band photometry spanning up to 12 \${\textbackslash}mu\$, the scatter decreases by more than 10\% over the fiducial case. Finally, using the 12 bands together with optical colours and linear sizes gives \${\textbackslash}delta z{\textless}4e-5\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_z{\textless}0.019\$. This paper also serves as a reference for two public photo-z catalogues accompanying KiDS DR3, both obtained using the ANNz2 code. The first one, of general purpose, includes all the 39 million KiDS sources with four-band ugri measurements in DR3. The second dataset, optimized for low-redshift studies such as galaxy-galaxy lensing, is limited to r{\textless}20, and provides photo-zs of much better quality than in the full-depth case thanks to incorporating optical magnitudes, colours, and sizes in the GAMA-calibrated photo-z derivation.},

Itsmain objective is to take a census of the stellar content of our Galaxy, with the goal of revealing its formation and evolution. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textquoteright}s unique feature is the measurement of parallaxes and proper motions with hitherto unparalleled accuracy for many objects. As a survey, the physical properties of most of these objects are unknown. Here we describe the data analysis system put together by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}consortium to classify these objects and to infer their astrophysical properties using the satellite{\textquoteright}s data. This system covers single stars, (unresolved) binary stars, quasars, and galaxies, all covering a wide parameter space. Multiple methods are used for many types of stars, producing multiple results for the end user according to different models and assumptions. Prior to its application to real {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}data the accuracy of these methods cannot be assessed definitively. But as an example of the current performance, we can attain internal accuracies (rms residuals) on F, G, K, M dwarfs and giants at {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 15 ({\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 15{\textendash}17) for a wide range of metallicites and interstellar extinctions of around 100 K in effective temperature ({\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}), 0.1 mag in extinction ({\textless}i{\textgreater}A{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}), 0.2 dex in metallicity ([Fe/H]), and 0.25 dex in surface gravity (log {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater}). The accuracy is a strong function of the parameters themselves, varying by a factor of more than two up or down over this parameter range. After its launch in December 2013, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}will nominally observe for five years, during which the system we describe will continue to evolve in light of experience with the real data.},

This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new method for optimally compacting a continuous distribution \$F\$ into a representative point set called projected support points. As its name suggests, the primary appeal of projected support points is that it provides an optimal representation of not only the full distribution \$F\$, but its marginal distributions as well. These point sets have numerous important applications in statistics and engineering, because many practical, high-dimensional sampling or integration problems typically have low-dimensional structure which can be exploited. In this work, a unifying framework is presented for projected support points, connecting the desired goodness-of-fit on marginal distributions with important principles in experimental design and Quasi-Monte Carlo. Two algorithms are then proposed for efficient optimization of projected support points, with simulation studies confirming the effectiveness of the proposed point set both in representing marginal distributions and in integrating functions with low-dimensional structure. An important application of projected support points -- as a way to optimally compact Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains -- is then highlighted using a Bayesian age-cohort model for breast cancer.},

The contamination and completeness of the cluster catalog are derived using mock catalogs based on the data themselves. The optimal signal to noise threshold for the cluster detection is obtained by randomizing the galaxy positions and selecting the value that produces a contamination of less than 20\%. Starting from a subset of clusters detected with high significance at low redshifts, we shift them to higher redshifts to estimate the completeness as a function of redshift: the average completeness is {\textasciitilde}85\%.

It aims to image 1500 square degrees in four filters (ugri). The core science driver is mapping the large-scale matter distribution in the Universe, using weak lensing shear and photometric redshift measurements. Further science cases include galaxy evolution, Milky Way structure, detection of high-redshift clusters, and finding rare sources such as strong lenses and quasars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Here we present the third public data release and several associated data products, adding further area, homogenized photometric calibration, photometric redshifts and weak lensing shear measurements to the first two releases. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: A dedicated pipeline embedded in the Astro-WISE information system is used for the production of the main release. Modifications with respect to earlier releases are described in detail. Photometric redshifts have been derived using both Bayesian template fitting, and machine-learning techniques. For the weak lensing measurements, optimized procedures based on the THELI data reduction and lensfit shear measurement packages are used. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: In this third data release an additional 292 new survey tiles (?300 deg{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) stacked ugri images are made available, accompanied by weight maps, masks, and source lists. The multi-band catalogue, including homogenized photometry and photometric redshifts, covers the combined DR1, DR2 and DR3 footprint of 440 survey tiles (44 deg{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}). Limiting magnitudes are typically 24.3, 25.1, 24.9, 23.8 (5$\sigma$ in a 2'' aperture) in ugri, respectively, and the typical r-band PSF size is less than 0.7''. The photometric homogenization scheme ensures accurate colours and an absolute calibration stable to ?2\% for gri and ?3\% in u.

This result is ingood agreement with other low-redshift probes of large-scale structure, including recent cosmic shear results, along with pre-Planck cosmic microwave background constraints. A 2.3$\sigma$ tension in S8 and 'substantial discordance' in the full parameter space is found with respect to the Planck 2015 results. We use shear measurements for nearly 15 million galaxies, determined with a new improved 'self-calibrating' version of lensFIT validated using an extensive suite of image simulations. Four-band ugri photometric redshifts are calibrated directly with deep spectroscopic surveys. The redshift calibration is confirmed using two independent techniques based on angular cross-correlations and the properties of the photometric redshift probability distributions. Our covariance matrix is determined using an analytical approach, verified numerically with large mock galaxy catalogues. We account for uncertainties in the modelling of intrinsic galaxy alignments and the impact of baryon feedback on the shape of the non-linear matter power spectrum, in addition to the small residual uncertainties in the shear and redshift calibration. The cosmology analysis was performed blind. Our high-level data products, including shear correlation functions, covariance matrices, redshift distributions, and Monte Carlo Markov chains are available at http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl.},

We compare our joint probe measurement to the theoretical expectation for a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology, assuming the best-fitting cosmological parameters from the KiDS-450 cosmic shear and Planck CMB analyses. We find that our results are consistent within 1$\sigma$ with the KiDS-450 cosmology, with an amplitude re-scaling parameter AKiDS~=~0.86~{\textpm}~0.19. Adopting a Planck cosmology, we find our results are consistent within 2$\sigma$, with APlanck~=~0.68 {\textpm} 0.15. We show that the agreement is improved in both cases when the contamination to the signal by intrinsic galaxy alignments is accounted for, increasing A by \~{}0.1. This is the first tomographic analysis of the galaxy lensing {\textendash} CMB lensing cross-correlation signal, and is based on five photometric redshift bins. We use this measurement as an independent validation of the multiplicative shear calibration and of the calibrated source redshift distribution at high redshifts. We find that constraints on these two quantities are strongly correlated when obtained from this technique, which should therefore not be considered as a stand-alone competitive calibration tool.},

	abstract = {We present galaxy{\textendash}galaxy lensing results from 139~deg2 of Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data. Our lens sample consists of red galaxies, known as redMaGiC, which are specifically selected to have a low photometric redshift error and outlier rate. The lensing measurement has a total signal-to-noise ratio of 29 over scales 0.09 \&lt; R \&lt; 15~Mpc~h-1, including all lenses over a wide redshift range 0.2 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.8. Dividing the lenses into three redshift bins for this constant moving number density sample, we find no evidence for evolution in the halo mass with redshift. We obtain consistent results for the lensing measurement with two independent shear pipelines, ngmix and im3shape. We perform a number of null tests on the shear and photometric redshift catalogues and quantify resulting systematic uncertainties. Covariances from jackknife subsamples of the data are validated with a suite of 50 mock surveys. The result and systematic checks in this work provide a critical input for future cosmological and galaxy evolution studies with the DES data and redMaGiC galaxy samples. We fit a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, and demonstrate that our data constrain the mean halo mass of the lens galaxies, despite strong degeneracies between individual HOD parameters.},

	abstract = {We determine the accuracy of galaxy redshift distributions as estimated from photometric redshift probability distributions p(z). Our method utilizes measurements of the angular cross-correlation between photometric galaxies and an overlapping sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. We describe the redshift leakage from a galaxy photometric redshift bin j into a spectroscopic redshift bin i using the sum of the p(z) for the galaxies residing in bin j. We can then predict the angular cross-correlation between photometric and spectroscopic galaxies due to intrinsic galaxy clustering when i /= j as a function of the measured angular cross-correlation when i = j. We also account for enhanced clustering arising from lensing magnification using a halo model. The comparison of this prediction with the measured signal provides a consistency check on the validity of using the summed p(z) to determine galaxy redshift distributions in cosmological analyses, as advocated by the Canada{\textendash}France{\textendash}Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We present an analysis of the photometric redshifts measured by CFHTLenS, which overlaps the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We also analyse the Red-sequence Cluster Lensing Survey, which overlaps both BOSS and the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We find that the summed p(z) from both surveys are generally biased with respect to the true underlying distributions. If unaccounted for, this bias would lead to errors in cosmological parameter estimation from CFHTLenS by less than \~{}4 per cent. For photometric redshift bins which spatially overlap in 3D with our spectroscopic sample, we determine redshift bias corrections which can be used in future cosmological analyses that rely on accurate galaxy redshift distributions.},

When perform astrophysical analyses, it is necessary to treat the uncertainties of the estimates correctly.

	abstract = {Determining the redshift distribution n ( z ) of galaxy samples is essential for several cosmological probes including weak lensing. For imaging surveys, this is usually done using photometric redshifts estimated on an object-by-object basis. We present a new approach for directly measuring the global n ( z ) of cosmological galaxy samples, including uncertainties, using forward modeling. Our method relies on image simulations produced using \textsc{UFig} (Ultra Fast Image Generator) and on ABC (Approximate Bayesian Computation) within the MCCL (Monte-Carlo Control Loops) framework. The galaxy population is modeled using parametric forms for the luminosity functions, spectral energy distributions, sizes and radial profiles of both blue and red galaxies. We apply exactly the same analysis to the real data and to the simulated images, which also include instrumental and observational effects. By adjusting the parameters of the simulations, we derive a set of acceptable models that are statistically consistent with the data. We then apply the same cuts to the simulations that were used to construct the target galaxy sample in the real data. The redshifts of the galaxies in the resulting simulated samples yield a set of n ( z ) distributions for the acceptable models. We demonstrate the method by determining n ( z ) for a cosmic shear like galaxy sample from the 4-band Subaru Suprime-Cam data in the COSMOS field. We also complement this imaging data with a spectroscopic calibration sample from the VVDS survey. We compare our resulting posterior n ( z ) distributions to the one derived from photometric redshifts estimated using 36 photometric bands in COSMOS and find good agreement. This offers good prospects for applying our approach to current and future large imaging surveys.},

Reliance on photometrically-determined redshifts constitutes a major source of uncertainty for these surveys. Additionally, interpreting the weak lensing signal requires a detailed understanding of the nonlinear physics of gravitational collapse. We present a new analysis of the stringent calibration requirements for weak lensing analyses of future imaging surveys that addresses both photo-z uncertainty and errors in the calibration of the matter power spectrum. We find that when photo-z uncertainty is taken into account the requirements on the level of precision in the prediction for the matter power spectrum are more stringent than previously thought. Including degree-scale galaxy clustering statistics in a joint analysis with weak lensing not only strengthens the survey's constraining power by {\textasciitilde}20\%, but can also have a profound impact on the calibration demands, decreasing the degradation in dark energy constraints with matter power spectrum uncertainty by a factor of 2-5. Similarly, using galaxy clustering information significantly relaxes the demands on photo-z calibration. We compare these calibration requirements to the contemporary state-of-the-art in photometric redshift estimation and predictions of the power spectrum and suggest strategies to utilize forthcoming data optimally.},

	abstract = {We describe the derivation and validation of redshift distribution estimates and their uncertainties for the galaxies used as weak lensing sources in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 cosmological analyses. The Bayesian Photometric Redshift (BPZ) code is used to assign galaxies to four redshift bins between z=0.2 and 1.3, and to produce initial estimates of the lensing-weighted redshift distributions \$n{\textasciicircum}i\_\{PZ\}(z)\$ for bin i. Accurate determination of cosmological parameters depends critically on knowledge of \$n{\textasciicircum}i\$ but is insensitive to bin assignments or redshift errors for individual galaxies. The cosmological analyses allow for shifts \$n{\textasciicircum}i(z)=n{\textasciicircum}i\_\{PZ\}(z-{\textbackslash}Delta z{\textasciicircum}i)\$ to correct the mean redshift of \$n{\textasciicircum}i(z)\$ for biases in \$n{\textasciicircum}i\_\{{\textbackslash}rm PZ\}\$. The \${\textbackslash}Delta z{\textasciicircum}i\$ are constrained by comparison of independently estimated 30-band photometric redshifts of galaxies in the COSMOS field to BPZ estimates made from the DES griz fluxes, for a sample matched in fluxes, pre-seeing size, and lensing weight to the DES weak-lensing sources. In companion papers, the \${\textbackslash}Delta z{\textasciicircum}i\$ are further constrained by the angular clustering of the source galaxies around red galaxies with secure photometric redshifts at 0.15{\textless}z{\textless}0.9. This paper details the BPZ and COSMOS procedures, and demonstrates that the cosmological inference is insensitive to details of the \$n{\textasciicircum}i(z)\$ beyond the choice of \${\textbackslash}Delta z{\textasciicircum}i\$. The clustering and COSMOS validation methods produce consistent estimates of \${\textbackslash}Delta z{\textasciicircum}i\$, with combined uncertainties of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}Delta z{\textasciicircum}i\}=\$0.015, 0.013, 0.011, and 0.022 in the four bins. We marginalize over these in all analyses to follow, which does not diminish the constraining power significantly. Repeating the photo-z procedure using the Directional Neighborhood Fitting (DNF) algorithm instead of BPZ, or using the \$n{\textasciicircum}i(z)\$ directly estimated from COSMOS, yields no discernible difference in cosmological inferences.},

We describe the improvements to the photometric calibration and the photo-z estimates in the Deep Lens Survey (DLS) from correcting three of the inputs to the photo-z calculation: the system response as a function of wavelength, the spectral energy distribution templates and template prior probabilities as a function of magnitude. We model the system response with a physical model of the MOSAIC camera's CCD, which corrects a 0.1 mag discrepancy in the colours of type M2 and later stars relative to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey z photometry. We provide our estimated z response function for the use of other surveys that used MOSAIC before its recent detector upgrade. The improved throughput curve, template set and Bayesian prior lead to general improvement in the predicted photometric redshifts, including a 20~per cent reduction in photo-z scatter at low redshift and a reduction of the bias by a factor of more than 2 at high redshift. This paper serves as both a photo-z data release description for DLS and a guide for testing the quality of photometry and resulting photo-zs generally.},

	abstract = {Photometric redshifts play an important role as a measure of distance for various cosmological topics. Spectroscopic redshifts are only available for a very limited number of objects but can be used for creating statistical models. A broad variety of photometric catalogues provide uncertain low resolution spectral information for galaxies and quasars that can be used to infer a redshift. Many different techniques have been developed to produce those redshift estimates with increasing precision. Instead of providing a point estimate only, astronomers start to generate probabilistic density functions (PDFs) which should provide a characterisation of the uncertainties of the estimation. In this work we present two simple approaches on how to generate those PDFs. We use the example of generating the photometric redshift PDFs of quasars from SDSS(DR7) to validate our approaches and to compare them with point estimates. We do not aim for presenting a new best performing method, but we choose an intuitive approach that is based on well known machine learning algorithms. Furthermore we introduce proper tools for evaluating the performance of PDFs in the context of astronomy. The continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the probability integral transform (PIT) are well accepted in the weather forecasting community. Both tools reflect how well the PDFs reproduce the real values of the analysed objects. As we show, nearly all currently used measures in astronomy show severe weaknesses when used to evaluate PDFs.},

	abstract = {We present the methodology for and detail the implementation of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 3x2pt DES Year 1 (Y1) analysis, which combines configuration-space two-point statistics from three different cosmological probes: cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering, using data from the first year of DES observations. We have developed two independent modeling pipelines and describe the code validation process. We derive expressions for analytical real-space multi-probe covariances, and describe their validation with numerical simulations. We stress-test the inference pipelines in simulated likelihood analyses that vary 6-7 cosmology parameters plus 20 nuisance parameters and precisely resemble the analysis to be presented in the DES 3x2pt analysis paper, using a variety of simulated input data vectors with varying assumptions. We find that any disagreement between pipelines leads to changes in assigned likelihood \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}le 0.045\$ with respect to the statistical error of the DES Y1 data vector. We also find that angular binning and survey mask do not impact our analytic covariance at a significant level. We determine lower bounds on scales used for analysis of galaxy clustering (8 Mpc\${\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) and galaxy-galaxy lensing (12 Mpc\${\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) such that the impact of modeling uncertainties in the non-linear regime is well below statistical errors, and show that our analysis choices are robust against a variety of systematics. These tests demonstrate that we have a robust analysis pipeline that yields unbiased cosmological parameter inferences for the flagship 3x2pt DES Y1 analysis. We emphasize that the level of independent code development and subsequent code comparison as demonstrated in this paper is necessary to produce credible constraints from increasingly complex multi-probe analyses of current data.},

	abstract = {Photometric redshifts are a key component of many science objectives in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). In this paper, we describe and compare the codes used to compute photometric redshifts for HSC-SSP, how we calibrate them, and the typical accuracy we achieve with the HSC five-band photometry (grizy). We introduce a new point estimator based on an improved loss function and demonstrate that it works better than other commonly used estimators. We find that our photo-z{\textquoteright}s are most accurate at 0.2 ? zphot ? 1.5, where we can straddle the 4000 {\r A} break. We achieve $\sigma$[$\Delta$zphot/(1~+~zphot)]~\~{}~0.05 and an outlier rate of about 15\% for galaxies down to i~=~25 within this redshift range. If we limit ourselves to a brighter sample of i~\&lt;~24, we achieve $\sigma$~\~{}~0.04 and \~{}8\% outliers. Our photo-z's should thus enable many science cases for HSC-SSP. We also characterize the accuracy of our redshift probability distribution function (PDF) and discover that some codes over-/underestimate the redshift uncertainties, which has implications for N(z) reconstruction. Our photo-z products for the entire area in Public Data Release 1 are publicly available, and both our catalog products (such as point estimates) and full PDFs can be retrieved from the data release site, ?https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/?.},

	abstract = {We present redshift probability distributions for galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 imaging data. We used the nearest-neighbor weighting algorithm to derive the ensemble redshift distribution N ( z ), and individual redshift probability distributions P ( z ) for galaxies with r {\textless} 21.8 and u {\textless} 29.0. As part of this technique, we calculated weights for a set of training galaxies with known redshifts such that their density distribution in five-dimensional color-magnitude space was proportional to that of the photometry-only sample, producing a nearly fair sample in that space. We estimated the ensemble N ( z ) of the photometric sample by constructing a weighted histogram of the training-set redshifts. We derived P ( z )'s for individual objects by using training-set objects from the local color-magnitude space around each photometric object. Using the P ( z ) for each galaxy can reduce the statistical error in measurements that depend on the redshifts of individual galaxies. The spectroscopic training sample is substantially larger than that used for the DR7 release. The newly added PRIMUS catalog is now the most important training set used in this analysis by a wide margin. We expect the primary sources of error in the N ( z ) reconstruction to be sample variance and spectroscopic failures: The training sets are drawn from relatively small volumes of space, and some samples have large incompleteness. Using simulations we estimated the uncertainty in N ( z ) due to sample variance at a given redshift to be 10\%-15\%. The uncertainty on calculations incorporating N ( z ) or P ( z ) depends on how they are used; we discuss the case of weak lensing measurements. The P ( z ) catalog is publicly available from the SDSS Web site.},

This aspect makes our estimator an ideal tool for evaluating the impact of changes to LSST survey parameters that affect the measurement errors of the photometry, which is the main motivation of our work (i.e., it is not intended to provide the {\textquotedblleft}best{\textquotedblright} photometric redshifts for LSST data). We show how the photometric redshifts will improve with time over the 10 year LSST survey and confirm that the nominal distribution of visits per filter provides the most accurate photo- z results. The LSST survey strategy naturally produces observations over a range of airmass, which offers the opportunity of using an SED- and z -dependent atmospheric affect on the observed photometry as a color-independent redshift indicator. We show that measuring this airmass effect and including it as a prior has the potential to improve the photometric redshifts and can ameliorate extreme outliers, but that it will only be adequately measured for the brightest galaxies, which limits its overall impact on LSST photometric redshifts. We furthermore demonstrate how this airmass effect can induce a bias in the photo- z results, and caution against survey strategies that prioritize high-airmass observations for the purpose of improving this prior. Ultimately, we intend for this work to serve as a guide for the expectations and preparations of the LSST science community with regard to the minimum quality of photo- z as the survey progresses.},

	abstract = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of {\textasciitilde}0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) {\textless} 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution {\textasciitilde}250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

	abstract = {Photometric surveys produce large-area maps of the galaxy distribution, but with less accurate redshift information than is obtained from spectroscopic methods. Modern photometric redshift (photo-z) algorithms use galaxy magnitudes, or colors, that are obtained through multi-band imaging to produce a probability density function (PDF) for each galaxy in the map. We used simulated data to study the effect of using different photo-z estimators to assign galaxies to redshift bins in order to compare their effects on angular clustering and galaxy bias measurements. We found that if we use the entire PDF, rather than a single-point (mean or mode) estimate, the deviations are less biased, especially when using narrow redshift bins. When the redshift bin widths are \${\textbackslash}backslashDelta z=0.1\$, the use of the entire PDF reduces the typical measurement bias from 5\%, when using single point estimates, to 3\%.},

We present cosmological constraints using tomographic weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure. We use two broad redshift bins 0.5 {\textbackslash}textless z\_p {\textbackslash}textless= 0.85 and 0.85 {\textbackslash}textless z\_p {\textbackslash}textless= 1.3 free of intrinsic alignment contamination, and measure the shear correlation function on angular scales in the range \~{}1-40 arcmin. We show that the problematic redshift scaling of the shear signal, found in previous CFHTLS data analyses, does not afflict the CFHTLenS data. For a flat Lambda-CDM model and a fixed matter density Omega\_m=0.27, we find the normalisation of the matter power spectrum sigma\_8=0.771 \${\textbackslash}backslash\$pm 0.041. When combined with cosmic microwave background data (WMAP7), baryon acoustic oscillation data (BOSS), and a prior on the Hubble constant from the HST distance ladder, we find that CFHTLenS improves the precision of the fully marginalised parameter estimates by an average factor of 1.5-2.

In this paper, we present a new, publicly available, parallel, machine learning algorithm that generates photometric redshift PDFs by using prediction trees and random forest techniques, which we have named TPZ.1 This new algorithm incorporates measurement errors into the calculation while also dealing efficiently with missing values in the data. In addition, our implementation of this algorithm provides supplementary information regarding the data being analysed, including unbiased estimates of the accuracy of the technique without resorting to a validation data set, identification of poor photometric redshift areas within the parameter space occupied by the spectroscopic training data, a quantification of the relative importance of the variables used to construct the PDF, and a robust identification of outliers. This extra information can be used to optimally target new spectroscopic observations and to improve the overall efficacy of the redshift estimation. We have tested TPZ on galaxy samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample and from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe-2 (DEEP2) survey, obtaining excellent results in each case. We also have tested our implementation by participating in the PHAT1 project, which is a blind photometric redshift contest, finding that TPZ performs comparable to if not better than other empirical photometric redshift algorithms. Finally, we discuss the various parameters that control the operation of TPZ, the specific limitations of this approach and an application of photometric redshift PDFs.},

In this paper, we present a novel and efficient Bayesian framework that combines the results from different photo-z techniques into a more powerful and robust estimate by maximizing the information from the photometric data. To demonstrate this, we use a supervised machine learning technique based on random forest, an unsupervised method based on self-organizing maps, and a standard template-fitting method but can be easily extended to other existing techniques. We use data from the DEEP2 survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to explore different methods for combining the predictions from these techniques. By using different performance metrics, we demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy of our final photo-z estimate over the best input technique, that the fraction of outliers is reduced, and that the identification of outliers is significantly improved when we apply a naive Bayes classifier to this combined information. Our more robust and accurate photo-z PDFs will allow even more precise cosmological constraints to be made by using current and future photometric surveys. These improvements are crucial as we move to analyse photometric data that push to or even past the limits of the available training data, which will be the case with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

In this paper, we extend this method and explore various applications of it, using both simulations and real data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In addition to estimating the redshift distribution for an entire sample, the weighting method enables accurate estimates of the redshift probability distribution, p(z), for each galaxy in a photometric sample. Use of p(z) in cosmological analyses can substantially reduce biases associated with traditional photometric redshifts, in which a single redshift estimate is associated with each galaxy. The weighting procedure also naturally indicates which galaxies in the photometric sample are expected to have accurate redshift estimates, namely those that lie in regions of photometric-observable space that are well sampled by the spectroscopic subsample. In addition to providing a method that has some advantages over standard photo-z estimates, the weights method can also be used in conjunction with photo-z estimates e.g. by providing improved estimation of N(z) via deconvolution of N(zphot) and improved estimates of photo-z scatter and bias.

	abstract = {In the next decade, the LSST will become a major facility for the astronomical community. However accurately determining the redshifts of the observed galaxies without using spectroscopy is a major challenge. Reconstruction of the redshifts with high resolution and well-understood uncertainties is mandatory for many science goals, including the study of baryonic acoustic oscillations. We investigate different approaches to establish the accuracy that can be reached by the LSST six-band photometry. We construct a realistic mock galaxy catalog, based on the GOODS survey luminosity function, by simulating the expected apparent magnitude distribution for the LSST. To reconstruct the photometric redshifts (photo-z's), we consider a template-fitting method and a neural network method. The photo-z reconstruction from both of these techniques is tested on real CFHTLS data and also on simulated catalogs. We describe a new method to improve photo-z reconstruction that efficiently removes catastrophic outliers via a likelihood ratio statistical test. This test uses the posterior probability functions of the fit parameters and the colors. We show that the photometric redshift accuracy will meet the stringent LSST requirements up to redshift \${\textbackslash}backslashsim2.5\$ after a selection that is based on the likelihood ratio test or on the apparent magnitude for galaxies with \$S/N{\textbackslash}textgreater5\$ in at least 5 bands. The former selection has the advantage of retaining roughly 35\% more galaxies for a similar photo-z performance compared to the latter. Photo-z reconstruction using a neural network algorithm is also described. In addition, we utilize the CFHTLS spectro-photometric catalog to outline the possibility of combining the neural network and template-fitting methods. We conclude that the photo-z's will be accurately estimated with the LSST if a Bayesian prior probability and a calibration sample are used.},

Interestingly, in dusty objects the optical depths for Ly$\alpha$ and the UV continuum are always similar, indicating that Ly$\alpha$ photons are not undergoing many scatters before escaping their galaxy. In contrast, the ratio of optical depths in low-reddening systems can vary widely, illustrating the diverse nature of the systems. Finally, we show that in the star-formation-rate-log-mass diagram, our LAEs fall above the "main-sequence" defined by z 3 continuum selected star-forming galaxies. In this respect, they are similar to submillimeter-selected galaxies, although most LAEs have much lower mass. {\textcopyright} 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

By developing a spectroscopic model for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) stellar locus in colour-colour space, synthesizing an expected stellar locus, and simultaneously solving for all unknown zero-points when fitting to the instrumental locus, we increase the calibration accuracy of stellar locus matching. We also use a new combined technique to estimate improved flat-field models for the Subaru SuprimeCam camera, forming star flats' based on the magnitudes of stars observed in multiple positions or through comparison with available measurements in the SDSS catalogue. These techniques yield galaxy magnitudes with reliable colour calibration ([lsim]0.01-0.02 mag accuracy) that enable us to estimate photometric redshift probability distributions without spectroscopic training samples. We test the accuracy of our photometric redshifts using spectroscopic redshifts zs for [\~{}]5000 galaxies in 27cluster fields with at least five bands of photometry, as well as galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, finding \{sigma\}((zp - zs)/(1 + zs)) \{approx\} 0.03 for the most probable redshift zp. We show that the full posterior probability distributions for the redshifts of galaxies with five-band photometry exhibit good agreement with redshifts estimated from thirty-band photometry in the COSMOS field. The growth of shear with increasing distance behind each galaxy cluster shows the expected redshift-distance relation for a flat \{Lambda\} cold dark matter (\{Lambda\}-CDM) cosmology. Photometric redshifts and calibrated colours are used in subsequent papers to measure the masses of 51 galaxy clusters from their weak gravitational shear and determine improved cosmological constraints. We make our PYTHON code for stellar locus matching publicly available at http://big-macs-calibrate.googlecode.com; the code requires only input catalogues and filter transmission functions.},

	abstract = {Accurately characterizing the redshift distributions of galaxies is essential for analysing deep photometric surveys and testing cosmological models. We present a technique to simultaneously infer redshift distributions and individual redshifts from photometric galaxy catalogues. Our model constructs a piecewise constant representation (effectively a histogram) of the distribution of galaxy types and redshifts, the parameters of which are efficiently inferred from noisy photometric flux measurements. This approach can be seen as a generalization of template-fitting photometric redshift methods and relies on a library of spectral templates to relate the photometric fluxes of individual galaxies to their redshifts. We illustrate this technique on simulated galaxy survey data, and demonstrate that it delivers correct posterior distributions on the underlying type and redshift distributions, as well as on the individual types and redshifts of galaxies. We show that even with uninformative priors, large photometric errors and parameter degeneracies, the redshift and type distributions can be recovered robustly thanks to the hierarchical nature of the model, which is not possible with common photometric redshift estimation techniques. As a result, redshift uncertainties can be fully propagated in cosmological analyses for the first time, fulfilling an essential requirement for the current and future generations of surveys.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07043},
	abstract = {We present a Bayesian approach to the redshift classification of emission-line galaxies when only a single emission line is detected spectroscopically. We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift \$\{{\textbackslash}backslashrm Ly\{{\textbackslash}backslashalpha\}\}\$-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified via an inferred rest-frame equivalent width \$(W\_\{{\textbackslash}backslashrm Ly{\textbackslash}backslashalpha\})\$ greater than \$20 \{{\textbackslash}backslashrm {\textbackslash}backslash,{\textbackslash}backslashAA\}\$. Our Bayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line luminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy populations in question, and it returns the probability that an object is an LAE given the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to classify \${\textbackslash}backslashsim\$\$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II] emitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our Bayesian method recovers \$86{\textbackslash}backslash\%\$ of LAEs missed by the traditional \$W\_\{{\textbackslash}backslashrm Ly{\textbackslash}backslashalpha\} {\textbackslash}textgreater 20 \{{\textbackslash}backslashrm {\textbackslash}backslash,{\textbackslash}backslashAA\}\$ cutoff over \$2 {\textbackslash}textless z {\textbackslash}textless 3\$, outperforming the equivalent width (EW) cut in both contamination and incompleteness. Our method can trade off between contamination and incompleteness by adjusting the stringency of the probability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE in order to maximize the recovery of cosmological information. In our simulations of HETDEX, the Bayesian method reduces the uncertainty in cosmological distance measurements by \$14{\textbackslash}backslash\%\$ with respect to the EW cut, equivalent to obtaining \$29{\textbackslash}backslash\%\$ more data. This method enables us to use classification probabilities, rather than just object labels, in large-scale structure analyses, and can be applied to narrowband emission-line surveys as well as upcoming large spectroscopic surveys including Euclid and WFIRST.},

	abstract = {We present an empirical method for estimating the underlying redshift distribution N(z) of galaxy photometric samples from photometric observables. The method does not rely on photometric redshift (photo-z) estimates for individual galaxies, which typically suffer from biases. Instead, it assigns weights to galaxies in a spectroscopic subsample such that the weighted distributions of photometric observables (e.g. multiband magnitudes) match the corresponding distributions for the photometric sample. The weights are estimated using a nearest neighbour technique that ensures stability in sparsely populated regions of colour-magnitude space. The derived weights are then summed in redshift bins to create the redshift distribution. We apply this weighting technique to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as well as to mock catalogues for the Dark Energy Survey, and compare the results to those from the estimation of photo-zs derived by a neural network algorithm. We find that the weighting method accurately recovers the underlying redshift distribution, typically better than the photo-z reconstruction, provided the spectroscopic subsample spans the range of photometric observables covered by the photometric sample.},

	abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting science opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg{\textasciicircum}2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg{\textasciicircum}2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r\~{}27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z\~{}1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

Our approach advocates the use of clustering measurements on all available scales, in contrast to previous works focusing only on linear scales. We also show how its accuracy can be enhanced by optimally sampling a dataset within its photometric space rather than applying the estimator globally. We show that the ultimate goal of this technique is to characterize the mapping between the space of photometric observables and redshift space as this characterization then allows us to infer the clustering-redshift p.d.f. of a single galaxy. We apply this technique to estimate the redshift distributions of luminous red galaxies and emission line galaxies from the SDSS, infrared sources from WISE and radio sources from FIRST. We show that consistent redshift distributions are found using both quasars and absorber systems as reference populations. This technique brings valuable information on the third dimension of astronomical datasets. It is widely applicable to a large range of extra-galactic surveys.},

Here we present an alternative route of the BAO analysis that uses the cross-correlation of sparse spectroscopic tracers with a much denser photometric sample, where the spectroscopic tracers can be quasars or bright, rare galaxies that are easier to access spectroscopically. We show that measurements of the cross-correlation as a function of the transverse comoving separation rather than the angular separation avoid a smearing of the BAO feature without mixing the different scales at different redshifts in the projection, even for a wide redshift slice \${\textbackslash}backslashDelta z{\textbackslash}backslashsimeq 1\$. The bias, scatter, and catastrophic redshift errors of the photometric sample affect only the overall normalization of the cross-correlation which can be marginalized over when constraining the angular diameter distance. As a specific example, we forecast an expected accuracy of the BAO geometrical test via the cross-correlation of the SDSS and BOSS spectroscopic quasar sample with a dense photometric galaxy sample that is assumed to have a full overlap with the SDSS/BOSS survey region. We show that this cross-correlation BAO analysis allows us to measure the angular diameter distances to a fractional accuracy of about 10\% at each redshift bin over \$1{\textbackslash}backslashsimlt z{\textbackslash}backslashsimlt 3\$, if the photometric redshift errors of the galaxies, \${\textbackslash}backslashsigma\_z/(1+z)\$, are better than 10-20\% level.},

Our luminosity function is in excellent agreement with, but has much smaller statistical errors than, an estimate from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data when the SDSS data are accurately translated to the bJ band and the luminosity functions are normalized in the same way. We use the luminosity function, along with maps describing the redshift completeness of the current 2dFGRS catalogue, and its weak dependence on apparent magnitude, to define a complete description of the 2dFGRS selection function. Details and tests of the calibration of the 2dFGRS photometric parent catalogue are also presented.},

	abstract = {We apply clustering-based redshift inference to all extended sources from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric catalogue, down to magnitude r = 22. We map the relationships between colours and redshift, without assumption of the sources' spectral energy distributions (SED). We identify and locate star-forming, quiescent galaxies, and AGN, as well as colour changes due to spectral features, such as the 4000 \${\textbackslash}backslash\$AA\{\} break, redshifting through specific filters. Our mapping is globally in good agreement with colour-redshift tracks computed with SED templates, but reveals informative differences, such as the need for a lower fraction of M-type stars in certain templates. We compare our clustering-redshift estimates to photometric redshifts and find these two independent estimators to be in good agreement at each limiting magnitude considered. Finally, we present the global clustering-redshift distribution of all Sloan extended sources, showing objects up to z \~{} 0.8. While the overall shape agrees with that inferred from photometric redshifts, the clustering redshift technique results in a smoother distribution, with no indication of structure in redshift space suggested by the photometric redshift estimates (likely artifacts imprinted by their spectroscopic training set). We also infer a higher fraction of high redshift objects. The mapping between the four observed colours and redshift can be used to estimate the redshift probability distribution function of individual galaxies. This work is an initial step towards producing a general mapping between redshift and all available observables in the photometric space, including brightness, size, concentration, and ellipticity.},

Fundamentally, because all major probes are affected by the underlying distribution of matter in the regions studied, there exist covariances between them that can provide information on cosmology. Combining multiple probes allows for more accurate (less contaminated by systematics) and more precise (since there is cosmological information encoded in cross-correlation statistics) measurements of dark energy. The potential of cross-correlation methods is only beginning to be realized. By bringing in information from other wavelengths, the capabilities of the existing probes of dark energy can be enhanced and systematic effects can be mitigated further. We present a mixture of work in progress and suggestions for future scientific efforts. Given the scope of future dark energy experiments, the greatest gains may only be realized with more coordination and cooperation between multiple project teams; we recommend that this interchange should begin sooner, rather than later, to maximize scientific gains.},

We combine the information from the clustering wedges with recent measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations and Type Ia supernovae to obtain constraints on the cosmological parameters of the standard \{Lambda\} cold dark matter (\{Lambda\}CDM) model and a number of potential extensions. The information encoded in the clustering wedges is most useful when the dark energy equation of state is allowed to deviate from its standard \{Lambda\}CDM value. The combination of all data sets shows no evidence of a deviation from a constant dark energy equation of state, in which case we find wDE = -1.013 \{+/-\} 0.064, in complete agreement with a cosmological constant. We explore potential deviations from general relativity (GR) by constraining the growth rate f(z) = d ln D(a)/d ln a, in which case the combination of the CMASS clustering wedges with CMB data implies f(z = 0.57) = 0.719-0.096+0.092, in accordance with the predictions of GR. Our results clearly illustrate the additional constraining power of anisotropic clustering measurements with respect to that of angle-averaged quantities.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9601079},
	abstract = {In a series of previous papers we have considered the reconstruction of the surface mass density of a cluster of galaxies from images of lensed faint background galaxies. We showed that the reconstructed surface mass density is not uniquely determined, but that there exists a global invariance transformation that leaves the shape of the images of the lensed galaxies unchanged. Because of this, only lower limits on the total mass of a cluster can be derived if no further informations besides image ellipticities are used. Throughout these papers we used the simplifying assumption that all sources are at the same redshift. In this paper we account for a redshift distribution of the faint galaxies, and in particular, some of these galaxies can lie in front of the cluster or can be cluster members. We show how the mass distribution of a cluster of galaxies can be obtained from images of these faint galaxies, if the redshift distribution of these galaxies is known. We demonstrate that for the reconstruction of non-critical clusters we need less information on the redshift distribution of the galaxies, i.e., we only need to know two or three moments of the distribution. We show that the mean mass density across the data field is still a free variable, i.e., there remains a global invariance transformation of the resulting mass density field. For non-critical clusters we can derive the transformation explicitly and it is similar to that derived previously for the case of a single redshift of the sources. We discuss several theoretical ideas to break the mass degeneracy; of those considered, we find that only the magnification effect on the number density of galaxy images can be used successfully in practice.},

	abstract = {The luminosity functions of galaxies and quasars provide invaluable information about galaxy and quasar formation. Estimating the luminosity function from magnitude-limited samples is relatively straightforward, provided that the distances to the objects in the sample are known accurately; techniques for doing this have been available for about 30 yr. However, distances are usually known accurately for only a small subset of the sample. This is true of the objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and will be increasingly true of the next generation of deep multicolour photometric surveys. Estimating the luminosity function when distances are only known approximately (e.g. photometric redshifts are available, but spectroscopic redshifts are not) is more difficult. I describe two algorithms which can handle this complication: one is a generalization of the Vmax algorithm, and the other is a maximum likelihood approach. Because these methods account for uncertainties in the distance estimate, they impact a broader range of studies. For example, they are useful for studying the abundances of galaxies which are sufficiently nearby that the contribution of peculiar velocity to the spectroscopic redshift is not negligible, so only a noisy estimate of the true distance is available. In this respect, peculiar velocities and photometric redshift errors have similar effects. The methods developed here are also useful for estimating the stellar luminosity function in samples where accurate parallax distances are not available.},

We find that the surface brightness prior eliminates a large fraction of outliers by lifting the degeneracy between the Lyman and 4000-{\textbackslash}AA breaks. Bias and scatter are improved by about a factor of 2 with the prior in each redshift bin in the range 0.4 {\textbackslash}textless z {\textbackslash}textless 1.3, for both the ground and space data.

First, it utilizes each galaxy's full redshift probability function, instead of an estimate of the photometric redshift based on the peak of the probability function and an associated Gaussian error. Second, it identifies cluster candidates through cross-checking the results of two substantially different selection techniques (the name 2TecX representing the cross-check of the two techniques). These are adaptations of the Voronoi Tesselations and Friends-Of-Friends methods. Monte Carlo simulations of mock catalogues show that cross-checking the cluster candidates found by the two techniques significantly reduces the detection of spurious sources. Furthermore, we examine the selection effects and relative strengths and weaknesses of either method. The simulations also allow us to fine-tune the algorithm's parameters, and define completeness and mass limit as a function of redshift. We demonstrate that the algorithm isolates high-redshift clusters at a high level of efficiency and low contamination.},

We test two photometric redshift codes, BPZ and EAZY, on each of two data sets and find that BPZ is consistently overconfident (the \$p(z)\$ are too narrow) while EAZY produces approximately the correct level of confidence. We show that this is because EAZY models the uncertainty in its spectral energy distribution templates, and that post-hoc smoothing of the BPZ \$p(z)\$ provides a reasonable substitute for detailed modeling of template uncertainties. Either remedy still leaves a small surplus of galaxies with spectroscopic redshift very far from the peaks.
