[the field overall -- basically, what did it look like when I started this Ph.D.?]

[what interesting problems/opportunities are the context for my work?  (drawing conclusions about the universe from vast quantities of uncertainty-dominated, limitations of photometry lead to methodological challenges, what was tried so far and why isn't it good enough)]

[what science can be done with that opportunity? (cosmology, and then some! the interesting problems are in testing LCDM, GR, inflation)]

[what I'm going to say in each chapter, one paragraph each, pose the problem I solve and say what chapter contains my solution]

[did I produce anything of value? if there's a product, maybe cite it here?]
