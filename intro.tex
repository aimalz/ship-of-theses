[the field overall -- basically, what did it look like when I started this Ph.D.?]

\begin{itemize}
	\item \Pz\ point estimates suffer from uncertainty and are being replaced by plethora of \pzpdf\ methods.
	\item ad hoc usage in cosmology, little use elsewhere
\end{itemize}

[what interesting problems/opportunities are the context for my work?  (drawing conclusions about the universe from vast quantities of uncertainty-dominated, limitations of photometry lead to methodological challenges, what was tried so far and why isn't it good enough)]

[what science can be done with that opportunity? (cosmology, and then some! the interesting problems are in testing LCDM, GR, inflation)]

[what I'm going to say in each chapter, one paragraph each, pose the problem I solve and say what chapter contains my solution]

[did I produce anything of value? if there's a product, maybe cite it here?]

\chapname~\chapalt{chapter} [status in terms of refereed publication process]

Each \chapname\ was co-authored with collaborators but the writing in each \chapname\ is mine.
Here, I describe my specific contributions to each \chapname:
\begin{enumerate}

{\item For \chap{chapter}, I did [things] with contributions to [parts] from [people].}
