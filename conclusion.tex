This dissertation concerns the use of probabilistic \pz\ estimates in inference (\Chap{chippr}) and more generically (\Chap{qp}), as well as the evaluation of the performance of \pzpdf s (\Chap{pzdc1}).
\aim{Expand this into a one-paragraph outline of all the chapters.}

\aim{Add a one-paragraph synopsis of each chapter including conclusions and what to do next, emphasizing the context of the problem and the scope of the results in the chapter.}

\aim{Summarize my overall research program, how this work fits into the field as a whole, what broadly remains to be done, and my vision for where the field is going.
\begin{itemize}
	\item use every part of the animal, don't throw away data
	\item must be careful and correct, or we will only get out what we put in
	\item how we make decisions about what's good and what's bad makes a difference, must \textit{design} metrics appropriate to our goals even when inconvenient
\end{itemize}}
