In this dissertation, I study the population of exoplanets using data from
NASA's \kepler\ Mission.
I apply novel techniques to discover previously unknown planets and planet
candidates.
I also develop a robust probabilistic method for making inferences about the
population of exoplanets based on catalogs of measurements.
Applying this population inference method to a catalog of planet candidates
transiting Sun-like stars \citep{Petigura:2013}, we make a prediction for the
rate of Earth analogs.
